Write a SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  |  1  |
| 2  |  1  |
| 3  |  1  |
| 4  |  2  |
| 5  |  1  |
| 6  |  2  |
| 7  |  2  |
+----+-----+

For example, given the above Logs table, 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+

Solutions:

---Soluion 1---
select
    distinct
    a.Num as ConsecutiveNums
from
    Logs as a, Logs as b, Logs as c
where
    a.Id + 1 = b.Id and b.Id + 1 = c.Id
    and a.Num = b.Num and b.Num = c.Num;
    
    
---Soluion 2---    
select distinct Num as ConsecutiveNums from 
(select 
Num, 
lead(Num,1) over(PARTITION BY Num order by id) as lead1,
lead(Num,2) over(PARTITION BY Num order by id) as lead2
from Logs) lg
where Num = lead1
and Num = lead2

    
---Soluion 3---    
with window_summary as
(
select Num
     , min(Num) over(ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as min_num
     , max(Num) over(ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as max_num 
     , count(Num) over(ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as count_num
from Logs
)
select distinct Num as ConsecutiveNums
from window_summary
where min_num = Num 
    and min_num = max_num
    and count_num = 3
